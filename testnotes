# Need to redefine this as a set of grouped user stories (grouped by functionality).

# Ordering expectation:
Active tasks:
  Goal order:
    - Goals with any incomplete tasks
    - Goals with any complete tasks
    - Goals with only on break tasks
  Task order under goals:
    - Incomplete
    - Complete
    - On break
Archived tasks:
  Goal order:
    - By archive date
  Task order:
    - Most recent complete
    - Most recent incomplete
    - Most recent on break

Semantic versioning notes:
  Major version (backwards incompatible):
    - Any ability to associate feedback removed (e.g. not being able to comment tasks)
    - Any functionality removed (e.g. archival, site administration, etc)
    - Any existing ID being removed
  Minor version (new feature):
    - Output ordering changes
    - New functionality added
  Patch version:
    - Missing IDs added
    - Non-user affecting changes to backend

Site:
# Registraiton and login/logout
    - Can register a new user on a new site, are logged in after registering
    - Can log in with existing user
    - Can log out as logged in user
    - Cannot register while logged in
    - User can disable registrations
    - Cannot register a new user while logged out with registrations disabled
    - Cannot log in while logged in

# Basic goals/task creation
    - Can create multiple goals at top level
    - Can create multiple tasks under a goal
    - Can create multiple goals under an existing goal

# User separation
    - Cannot see another user's task
    - Cannot see another user's archived tasks

# Basic task management
    - Check task shows correctly when going on break 
    - Before task is completed it shows as not completed and is clickable
    - Can fill in or not fill in comment when completing task
    - When task completed, task shows as completed and is unclickable on active tasks page
- Task shows up to 7 completed/not completed boxes on active tasks page, unclickable, with days of week
    - Uncompleted tasks are at top of list
    - Check that first go on break has correct id (including date)
- Can complete old instances of a task in the history page
- Task shows uncompleted for each day since beginning that it does not have task record for in history page
    - Can set a task to "I have a good excuse" in the history page

# Archiving
- Can archive a task
- Archived tasks do not appear in active tasks
- Archived tasks cannot be completed or 'holidayed'


# Basic navigation logged in
- Can reach archive and active tasks pages while logged in
- Home link takes to active tasks page if logged in
- Clicking username takes to user details page with name and e-mail address
    - Version link takes to version history

# Anonymous user
- Logged out user can only access home page
    - ...version
- ...login
    - ...and sometimes register

# Code quality
- flake8 should return no sadness
- coverage should be 100% (can we run that with hitch?)
- Appropriate groups should be present on each page as classes (e.g. go_on_break links)
