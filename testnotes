# Need to redefine this as a set of grouped user stories (grouped by functionality).
# Need to do some tests going by URL rather than just clicking through

# TODO: Input tests for goals and tasks should make sure expected name appears

# TODO: Do tests for the full ordering
# Ordering expectation:
Active tasks:
  Goal order:
    - Goals with any incomplete tasks
    - Goals with any complete tasks
    - Goals with only on break tasks
  Task order under goals:
    - Incomplete
    - Complete
    - On break
Archived tasks:
  Goal order:
    - By archive date
  Task order:
    - Most recent complete
    - Most recent incomplete
    - Most recent on break

    - Any existing ID being removed
  Minor version (new feature):
    - Output ordering changes
    - New functionality added
  Patch version:

    - Non-user affecting changes to backend

Site:
# Registraiton and login/logout
    - Can register a new user on a new site, are logged in after registering
    - Can log in with existing user
    - Can log out as logged in user
    - Cannot register while logged in
    - User can disable registrations
    - Cannot register a new user while logged out with registrations disabled
    - Cannot log in while logged in

# Basic goals/task creation
    - Can create multiple goals at top level
    - Can create multiple tasks under a goal
    - Can create multiple goals under an existing goal

# User separation
    - Cannot see another user's task
    - Cannot see another user's archived tasks
    - Cannot complete another user's task (by URL)
    - Cannot archive another user's task (by URL)
    - Cannot view another user's task history (by URL)

# Basic task management
    - Check task shows correctly when going on break 
    - Before task is completed it shows as not completed and is clickable
    - Can fill in or not fill in comment when completing task
    - When task completed, task shows as completed and is unclickable on active tasks page
    - Task shows up to 7 completed/not completed boxes on active tasks page, unclickable, with days of week # Need to be able to set date
    - Uncompleted tasks are at top of list
    - Check that first go on break has correct id (including date)
    - Can complete old instances of a task in the history page # Need to be able to set date
    - Can go_on_break old instances of a task in the history page # Need to be able to set date
    - Task shows uncompleted for each day since beginning that it does not have task record for in history page # Need to be able to set date
    - Can set a task to "I have a good excuse" in the history page

# Archiving
    - Can archive a task
    - Archived tasks do not appear in active tasks
    - Archived tasks appear in archived tasks
    - Archived tasks cannot be completed
    - Archived tasks cannot be 'holidayed'


# Basic navigation logged in
    - Can reach archive and active tasks pages while logged in
    - Home link takes to active tasks page if logged in
    - Clicking username takes to user details page with name and e-mail address
    - Version link takes to version history

# Anonymous user
    - Logged out user can only access home page
    - ...version
    - ...login
    - ...and sometimes register

# Comment/etc length + allowed characters
    - Goal name can be at least 200 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Task name can be at least 200 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Task break description can be at least 500 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Task completed description can be at least 500 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Username can be at least 50 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Password can be at least 100 characters, all <128 UTF-8 and arbitrary higher
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for goal name (started, needs better check)
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for task name (started, needs better check)
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for task complete
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for task on break
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for username
    - Check HTML closing tag followed by noise for password
    - LEFT FOR LATER- HTML injection fair start: Can't use chr(<33) very usefully; put tests in to make sure these characters don't crash the sit

# Email addresses being RFC valid to be handled later, when they're actually used

# Code quality
- flake8 should return no sadness
- coverage should be 100% (can we run that with hitch?)
- Appropriate groups should be present on each page as classes (e.g. go_on_break links)
